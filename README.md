# Spike

spike refers to a specific type of work or task that is designed to explore and investigate an issue or technology. Spikes are used to address uncertainties, reduce risks, and gain knowledge about a specific problem to make informed decisions about how to proceed. They are time-boxed and have specific goals, but they are not directly aimed at delivering a working product increment.
